                    <p>Hi there, I’m Rasha! I’m sixteen years old and I attend Shaftesbury high school. I grew up in Toronto, but I moved to Winnipeg a couple years ago. I live with my parents and two sisters, one older and one younger. These people are my only family within a thousand-kilometre radius so I’d say we’re pretty close.
                        <br></br>
                        Technology has always been a huge part of my life. My first interaction with technology was probably my TV, but only after I gained access to the Internet did I gain an interest in technology. To me, the world of internet gaming was absolutely revolutionary, and the idea that I could talk to my friends through a screen had always baffled me. To be honest, it still does.
                        <br></br>
                        I’m constantly trying something new. I am open to experience and learning new things about the world. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with synthesisers, video animation, and obscure history facts. A lot of my hobbies and interests are short-lasting, which is why I like to make them into little projects. So far, I’ve finished a quarter of a screenplay, and an empty youtube channel for my animation videos. Nothing’s finished yet, but the process of creation is the best part.
