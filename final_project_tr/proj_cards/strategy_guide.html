                <h1>Choosing Brawlers to Win a Match: A Brawl Stars Strategy Guide</h1>
                <br>
                <h3>Posted 11/7/2021</h3>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    To win a match in Brawlstars, you will need to defeat your opponents before time runs out. Getting to that point is a lot more than luck; it’s effective planning and the implementation of strategies. If you want to play like a pro and max out your trophies, you will need to understand how every aspect of the game can be used to your advantage— starting with the brawlers.
                    <br></br>
                    If you <b>are new to Brawlstars,</b> <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide/">click here for a Beginner’s Guide.</a>
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>Brawlers</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Like most multiplayer games, you are left with a wide selection of characters to choose from before entering a match. These characters can have different strengths and weaknesses. In Brawlstars, those are called <b>brawlers</b>. Brawlstars includes over 50 brawlers and choosing which one to play as is one of the most important decisions made pre-game.
                    <br></br>
                    All brawlers have <b>traits</b> that can be exploited to win a match. These traits can be their rarity, class, max health, movement speed, attacking range, reload speed, and super attack.
                    <br></br>
                    If you want to compare brawlers back-to-back, <a href="#">click here for a table.</a> 
                    <br></br>
                    At first glance, these traits make it seem obvious who to choose. For example, choosing a brawler with a greater max health like El Primo would appear to be the best option. But after looking closely at all his traits, you see that he is disadvantaged by his short attacking range. In some instances, a short attacking range is advantageous, but how do you know when? This is where coordination with events and maps come into play.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>Events</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In essence, Brawl Stars events are simply games, the objective being to defeat the other team(s). A lot of these events have very specific tasks to carry-out for to receive a victory, and this has every part in <b>deciding which brawler to use.</b>
                    <br></br>
                    Let’s say you have decided to play a match in <b>Gem Grab</b>. The objective of the event is to retrieve a larger number of gems than your opponents’ team. You and your team will likely hinder in the middle of the map where the <b>Gem Mine</b> is, and so will the opposing team. This spot puts you and your team at exposure, therefore creating a risk of constantly being attacked, and evidently losing your teams’ gems.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <p>
                    <i>Image Source: Brawlify – Full scale version of the “Four Squared” Gem Grab map.</i>
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    When choosing a brawler before a Gem Grab match, you should consider someone who has a higher <b>Max Health</b>, or a ‘Support’ class brawler, like <b>Pam</b> or <b>Poco</b>. With these brawlers, you will withstand the attacks from your opponents, or you can heal yourself using your super attack or gadgets.
                    <br></br>
                    Another example of coordinating these brawler-specific traits with an event can be seen in a <b>Heist match</b>. The <b>objective</b> of the event is to deal as much damage as possible to your opponents’ safe. The safe typically has some sort of barrier, most often a landscaping obstacle i.e. fence, blocks, bodies of water, etc. A good choice of brawler for this event would be someone with a fast <b>Reload Speed</b>, or a brawler with a <b>Super Attack that allows them to jump</b> i.e. “Vault” or “Flying Elbow Drop.” <b>El Primo</b> or <b>Edgar</b> would be the ideal candidates because they can both use their super to jump over obstacles and recharge their power quick enough to land as many hits as possible on the opponents safe.
                    <br></br>
                    Brawl Stars tend to <b>change their events on an hourly-basis</b>, but most remain consistent.
                    <br></br>
                    The following is a list of Brawl Stars’ <b>most consistent events in descending order</b>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Showdown (Solo + Duo)</li>
                    <li>Gem Grab</li>
                    <li>Brawl Ball</li>
                    <li>Bounty</li>
                    <li>Knockout</li>
                    <li>Heist</li>
                    <li>Hot Zone</li>
                    <li>Siege</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <h2>Map Styles</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The map style of an event is the most significant deciding factor on which brawler to play. Every event has a map style, and like the events, the <b>map style changes on an hourly-basis</b>.
                    <br></br>
                    Map styles consist of landscaping that build the event to take the form of an arena. Sometimes the landscaping of a map is limited, giving players more freedom to move, and other times the landscaping will restrict players movement and guide them through a specific course.
                    <br></br>
                    Maps can be categorised by how much freedom of movement they give players in two types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open</li>
                    <li>Obstructive</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    An <b>open style map</b> allows brawlers to move and attack freely due to the lack of landscaping and leaves no opportunities for surprise attacks. When choosing a brawler for an open style map, you should consider a brawler with a <b>Long Attacking Range</b> like <b>Shelley</b> or <b>Colt</b>.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <img src="https://cdn.brawlify.com/map/Deep-End.png"></a>
                <p>
                    <i>Image Source: Brawlify – The “Deep End” Knockout map is a fitting example of an open style map because of the sparse landscaping.</i>
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    An <b>obstructive style map</b> on the other hand, makes use of landscape to create obstructions, limiting the freedom of movement and range. For an obstructive style map, choosing a brawler that has a <b>Short Attacking Range</b> is ideal because then you can direct your attack more specifically, and your attacks won’t be obstructed by the landscaping. You can also take into consideration the <b>Super Attack</b> trait, in which a brawler can either destroy obstacles, or jump over them. The most ideal brawlers to play in an obstructive style map is <b>El Primo</b> or <b>Edgar</b> because they both share a Short Attacking range and the jumping super attack in common.
                </p>

                </p>
