                    <p>    
                        Making Jack-o’-lanterns has become a Halloween tradition. They can be seen on the porches of neighbours, or even as indoor Halloween decor. Making one of your own may seem difficult, but with this guide, the right tools and knowledge, you will be able to join in on the fun this Halloween.

                    <p>    
                        To make your jack-o’-lantern, there are a few items you need. You can get these at a local supermarket.
                    </p>

                        What you will need to carve a pumpkin:
                    </p>
                    <br>    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Permanent/strong marker</li>
                            <li>Sharp knife or pumpkin carving tool kit</li>
                            <li>Large spoon, ladle, or ice cream scooper</li>
                            <li>Bowl/container</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        Pick a design that you would like to carve into your pumpkin. This could be a face, a Halloween silhouette, or some other creative image."<br></br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a variety of different shapes and patterns a  jack-o’-lantern face that can give off different themes. A jack-o’-lantern with triangle eyes and a jaggedy carved mouth can appear scary, whereas a triangle eyed jack-o’-lantern with a crescent shaped grin is friendly (Refer to Figure 2). Once you have decided what you want it to look like, you are ready to begin.<br></br>

                        <br></br>

                    <p>
                        The pumpkin should be cleared of its contents before it is carved into. This is because it would be very difficult to cut into a solid pumpkin as opposed to a hollow one. To empty it, take your knife and cut a circle around the pumpkin handle. The hole should be big enough so that the pumpkin contents can be emptied into your container easily.<br></br> 
    
                        After you have done this, pull on the stem of the pumpkin and it should slide out easily. If the hole you cut does not slide out with the stem, you haven’t cut it properly. Once you open the pumpkin lid, use a spoon to scrape the inside of the pumpkin so it is hollow. Take the pumpkin contents and dump them into your container (you could also choose to save them for other purposes). Once you have a hollow pumpkin, it is ready to be carved.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                        <li><h2>Carving the face</h2></li>
                        <br></br>

                    <p>
                        To carve the pumpkin, you will need your permanent marker. Draw the shapes and patterns into the pumpkin based on how you want the face to be. Once you have your desired carving outline, take your knife and cut into the lines. Once you have cut a shape from the starting point and back, pop the piece out from inside the pumpkin and discard it.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                        <li><h2>Lighting the Pumpkin</h2></li>
                        <br></br>

                    <p>
                        Now that you have a pumpkin with a face, there is still one more step. The lighting. This step is optional, but most  jack-o’-lanterns have lights.<br></br>
    
                        There are many ways to light your pumpkin. The easiest way is to take a lit candle, and place it inside the pumpkin. Another way to light your jack-o’-lantern is to use battery-powered led lights and stuff them inside.<br></br>
    
                        After you have chosen a pumpkin face, emptied the pumpkin, carved the face, and lit it, you have a traditional jack-o'-lantern. You can choose to place it on your porch, or keep it inside, or whatever you please!<br></br>
