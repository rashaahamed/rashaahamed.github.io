                <h1>SSL Research Paper</h1>
                <br>
                <h3>Posted 11/7/2021</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let’s say you’re browsing on the internet to find a reputable non-profit to donate money to. You find a website, but you’re not sure if it’s legitimate. When you click on the link, you realize one of two things; that the website has a padlock next to the URL, or that the URL begins with ‘https’. So, what does this mean, and should you continue to donate to this website? Simply put, the ‘s’ in https establishes an encrypted link between the website and your browser. This allows for secure transactions between website and browser, meaning that you can donate to this website safely. The encrypted link is generated through an internet security protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is a digital certificate that enables an encrypted transaction between a web server and a browser. 
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>When was SSL made?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Not long after the first web browser was released, the SSL protocol was developed by Netscape, a web service company. The first version of SSL 1.0 was created in 1994, but it was not secure enough. A year later, Netscape released a version 2.0, which was called Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (https).
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You might have seen https in the URL of a website before. To understand what https is, you will need background information. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) is a protocol used to transfer hypertext. Hypertext in this context, is the files to HTML documents of the website. Http alone, was not enough to keep hackers from tampering with websites to steal user’s information. This results in the development of https, the upgraded and more secure version of http.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>How does SSL work?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So, the bottom line is that SSL keeps you safe. But this begs two questions, how, and why? SSL works in a process. As your browser attempts to connects to a website, the browser requests that the website identifies itself. The website does this by sending a copy of its SSL certificate. Your browser does a background check, and once the certificate is validated, the website starts an encryption session.<br></br>

                    The SSL digital certificate is important, for a website owner and a website user. Let’s say that Mary, a small business owner decides to start a website to sell her hand-crafted soaps. Mary has not yet gotten an SSL certificate for her website. Users do not feel safe making purchases on her website because they don’t see a padlock or https indicator. This is bad for Mary’s business image because she has not yet implemented digital security to keep her customers safe, and her brand seems illegitimate. If a user were to buy a product from Mary’s website, their personal information such as usernames, passwords, and even banking information can be stolen by hackers. This attack is called the “man-in-the-middle attack.”<br></br>

                    But there was a time when even SSL didn’t protect web users. In 1999, SSL version 3.0 was found to have vulnerabilities, which stems the birth of a new security protocol. A company called Internet Engineering Task Force creates a new protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) that patches the SSL bugs from version 3.0. This causes SSL to be replaced, making TLS the standard internet security protocol. Although TLS has completely replaced SSL, they are still the same internet protocol. As technology evolves, so do hackers. Today, SSL/TLS continues to upgrade to prevent any further vulnerabilities that can put users at risk.<br></br>
